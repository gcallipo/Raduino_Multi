# Raduino_Multi


The Raduino Multi project was born as an extension of the Raduino v.1.20.1 base firmware written by Allard Munters PE1NWL. The project allows you to operate in Multi Band to use the Bitx40 radio on other HF bands.

In the new version v.1.0.1, a simple Smeter was added and the related circuit can be found in schematics.
